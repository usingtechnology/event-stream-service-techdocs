## Deployment (Local Development)

### Developer Workstation Requirements/Setup

This repository includes a DevContainer configuration for local development and testing. You can build and verify the documentation locally before pushing changes.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

#### Setup Steps

1. **Open in DevContainer:**
   - Open this repository in VS Code
   - Press `F1` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
   - Wait for the container to build (first time may take a few minutes)

2. **Build the Documentation:**
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```
   This generates the static site in the `site/` directory.

3. **Serve Locally (with live reload):**
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
   The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and will automatically reload when you make changes.

4. **Check for Broken Links:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-links.sh
   ```
   This script builds the docs, starts a local server, and checks for broken links.

#### Application Specific Setup

The DevContainer uses the official `spotify/techdocs` Docker image, which includes:
- MkDocs with TechDocs core plugin
- All necessary dependencies for building Backstage TechDocs

Additional plugins and extensions (`ezlinks`, `mkpatcher`) are automatically installed via `requirements.txt` when the container is created.
