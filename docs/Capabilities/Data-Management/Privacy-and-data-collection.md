## Privacy
It's your responsibility to comply with privacy laws governing the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information.

Access to the Event Stream Service does not grant you permission to collect, use or disclose any personal information. Before publishing or distributing your form, you must discuss the intention of the form with your [Ministry Privacy Officer](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A749F080FC794D82A2CBD96BABA2ABEC) and complete assessments as required.

We recommend that program areas that create forms complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). Since each survey and form are unique, it's challenging to capture all the individual components in one overarching PIA.
To learn more about Privacy Impact Assessments, refer to the following resources:

## Data storage
<!-- **[Back to top](#top)** -->

The Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) hosts the data within Canada. The system admin team does not have any elevated permissions to view forms or form submissions through the frontend. Like other applications, a developer or database administrator will have access to the database passwords used to maintain the database.
